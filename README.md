## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

### ✔ Categorical Encoding  
Applied One-Hot Encoding for:
- model  
- transmission  
- fuelType  

### ✔ Feature Scaling  
Used StandardScaler for:
- year  
- mileage  
- tax  
- mpg  
- engineSize  

### ✔ Train-Test Split  
Split dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing**.
